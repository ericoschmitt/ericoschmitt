//Work done:

// After I wrote the basic > < == conditionals, prompt and loop, I then implemented the following improvements:

/*   Make the random secret number not include zero (1 to 1000).
  Add a 'start' button instead of prompting after loading page.
  Each time 'start' is pressed it's a new secret number.
  Restrict player prompt imput between 1-1000.
  Restrict to int numbers only.
  Refuse empty input when clicking OK.
  Next loop iteration requires a new number. Store guesses in an array and compare.
  Exit script when clicking Cancel (null => break).
  State the number just guessed.
  Count how many guesses already, but only when it's a number between 1-1000.
  What is the biggest number of guesses you should possibly need if you always guess a number in the middle? It's 10 guesses (2Ë†10 = 1024). Allow only up to 10 guesses or player looses.
  Prompt states how many guesses left until 10th
  CSS: button (center bottom) and logo (center top-%)

To do:
I could have used functions.
